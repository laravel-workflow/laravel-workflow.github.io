# Commercial Support

Durable Workflow is an open-source project and is free to use under the MIT license.

Commercial support and consultancy are **entirely optional** and are offered for teams that want additional assurance, maintainer-level guidance, or a formal escalation path when using Durable Workflow in production systems.

Using Durable Workflow does **not** require a commercial agreement, and all functionality remains fully open source regardless of whether commercial support is used.

## What Commercial Support Covers

Support engagements are led by the project maintainer and typically include:

- **Workflow architecture & design reviews**  
  Guidance on modeling workflows correctly, including activity boundaries, signals, inbox/outbox usage, and long-running execution patterns.

- **Determinism & replay safety guidance**  
  Help identifying and avoiding non-deterministic behavior, replay issues, and subtle correctness problems that can surface over time.

- **Upgrade & versioning strategy**  
  Assistance with safe upgrades, workflow versioning, and determining when patterns like `continue-as-new` are required.

- **Debugging complex workflow behavior**  
  Support with diagnosing stuck workflows, unexpected loops, signal handling issues, and other hard-to-reason-about runtime behavior.

- **Backports & patches**  
  Access to fixes and backports for supported versions to help avoid maintaining private forks.

- **Custom integrations (by arrangement)**  
  Help integrating Durable Workflow with existing systems such as chat platforms, approval systems, internal APIs, or observability tooling.

## Who This Is For

Commercial support is typically a good fit if you are:

- Running Durable Workflow in **production**
- Building **long-running or human-in-the-loop workflows**
- Operating in an environment where **correctness and upgrade safety matter**
- Looking for **maintainer-level expertise** rather than generic consulting
- Wanting to avoid forks and long-term maintenance risk
