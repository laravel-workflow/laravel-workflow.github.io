# Support

Durable Workflow is an open-source project and is free to use under the MIT license.

## Community Support

The primary way to get help with Durable Workflow is through the community.

This is the best place for:
- usage questions
- workflow modeling advice
- help understanding determinism and replay
- sharing ideas and patterns
- reporting bugs or unexpected behavior

### GitHub Discussions

GitHub Discussions is the preferred place for longer-form questions, design discussions, and issues that may benefit others.

### Discord

Discord is best for:
- quick questions
- informal discussion
- early feedback
- community collaboration

Community support is provided on a best-effort basis and is often sufficient for development, experimentation, and many production use cases.

## Commercial Support (Optional)

For teams that need additional assurance or maintainer-level expertise, commercial support and consultancy are available.

Using Durable Workflow does **not** require a commercial agreement, and all functionality remains fully open source regardless of whether commercial support is used.

Commercial support is intended for teams running Durable Workflow in production systems where correctness, upgrade safety, and long-running execution semantics matter.

## What Commercial Support Covers

Commercial support engagements are led by the project maintainer and typically include:

- **Workflow architecture & design reviews**  
  Guidance on modeling workflows correctly, including activity boundaries, signals, inbox/outbox usage, and long-running execution patterns.

- **Determinism & replay safety guidance**  
  Help identifying and avoiding non-deterministic behavior, replay issues, and subtle correctness problems that can surface over time.

- **Upgrade & versioning strategy**  
  Assistance with safe upgrades, workflow versioning, and determining when patterns like `continue-as-new` are required.

- **Debugging complex workflow behavior**  
  Support with diagnosing stuck workflows, unexpected loops, signal handling issues, and other hard-to-reason-about runtime behavior.

- **Backports & patches**  
  Access to fixes and backports for supported versions to help avoid maintaining private forks.

- **Custom integrations (by arrangement)**  
  Help integrating Durable Workflow with existing systems such as chat platforms, approval systems, internal APIs, or observability tooling.

## Who Commercial Support Is For

Commercial support is typically a good fit if you are:

- Running Durable Workflow in **production**
- Building **long-running or human-in-the-loop workflows**
- Operating in an environment where **correctness and upgrade safety matter**
- Looking for **maintainer-level expertise** rather than generic consulting
- Wanting to avoid forks and long-term maintenance risk
